# Nutrition Project
The Nutrition Project is a Java-based application built with Spring Boot. This project provides a RESTful API that allows users to explore various recipes along with their nutritional facts. Users can mark their favorite recipes, log their daily food intake, and calculate their total nutritional intake for a specific day.
## Features
**List Recipes:** Retrieve a list of recipes with detailed nutritional information, including calories, protein, fat, and carbohydrates.

**Add Recipe:** Add new recipes to the database with all relevant details.

**View Recipe Details:** Fetch detailed information for a specific recipe by its ID.

**Favorite Recipes:** Users can mark recipes as favorites for quick access.

**Food Logging:** Users can log what theyâ€™ve eaten, and the app will calculate the total calories and nutritional facts.
## Security
The application is secured using Spring Security. Users must authenticate to access the API, and role-based access control ensures that certain actions (like adding or deleting recipes) are restricted to authorized users.
